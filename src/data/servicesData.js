    <h2>SAP Greenfield</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Our SAP Greenfield services can help you implement a new SAP system quickly and efficiently, with minimal disruption to your business.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Implementing SAP S/4HANA with the Greenfield approach represents complete reengineering and the possibility of comprehensive simplification of processes, based on the latest technological innovations. The new implementation will be close to the SAP standard and best practices.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During the implementation, all processes and systems are completely reinstalled and configured and all environmental systems will be reassessed and replaced if necessary.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In-house developments in the core system are no longer up to date and are replaced by new architectures that allow a piece of software to be permanently modernized through regular and rapid updates. However, the new architectures can only be achieved with the Greenfield approach.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Greenfield's approach will not affect current business, because the existing SAP system - for example, SAP ERP 6.0 - will continue to operate parallel until the new S/4HANA system is go-live.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Benefits of Using Our SAP Greenfield Services:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Reduced risk: Our SAP Greenfield services can help you reduce the risk of implementation problems by providing you with a proven methodology and an experienced team of SAP consultants.</p>
